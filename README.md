**Overview**
      This project integrates Power BI with Generative AI (Python LLMs) to create a secure, intelligent legal analytics dashboard. It models case durations and outcomes using DAX, enhances insights with AI visuals and Smart Narratives, and automates LLM‑based case summaries.
The dashboard is deployed via Power BI Service with Row‑Level Security (RLS) to ensure stakeholder‑specific access.

**Objectives**
- Analyze and visualize case durations, outcomes, and trends.
- Automate summaries of legal cases using Python‑based LLMs.
- Provide AI‑driven insights through Smart Narratives and advanced visuals.
- Ensure secure, role‑based access with RLS.
- Share and collaborate seamlessly via Power BI Service.

  **Tools Required**
- Power BI Desktop & Service – dashboard design, DAX modeling, RLS, sharing.
- Python (Generative AI / LLMs) – automated case summaries and text analytics.
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – modeling case durations and outcomes.
- Power Query (M Language) – data cleaning and transformation.
- Smart Narratives & AI Visuals – automated insights and storytelling.
- Row‑Level Security (RLS) – secure stakeholder‑specific access.

**Expected Outcomes**
- Interactive dashboard showing case timelines, outcomes, and performance metrics.
- Automated LLM‑based summaries for quick case understanding.
- AI‑powered visual narratives that explain trends and anomalies.
- Secure, role‑specific views for lawyers, judges, and administrators.
- A scalable solution deployable via Power BI Service.

**Future Scope**
- Integration with court management systems for real‑time data.
- Advanced predictive modeling for case outcomes using ML.
- Natural language query support (Q&A with LLMs).
- Expansion to multi‑jurisdictional analytics.
- Embedding interactive dashboards into legal portals.

✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates how Power BI and Generative AI can transform legal analytics by combining data modeling, AI‑driven storytelling, and secure collaboration. It empowers stakeholders with actionable insights, reduces manual effort in case analysis, and sets the foundation for AI‑enabled legal decision support systems.
